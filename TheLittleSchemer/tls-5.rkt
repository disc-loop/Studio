; Explanation:
; The function removes a member in a list and any sublists. It looks for atoms in the first element, and will recursively traverse the sublists until it finds the member. When it finds the member, it continues through the sublist until it reaches the end of the sublist, upon where it will return the null list. For each member which is not the member to remove, the function adds the member to the result of recursing with the rest of the sublist.

; Roughly, for al, this looks like this:
; else -> car -> else -> car -> else -> car -> atom
;      -> cdr -> else -> car -> atom 
;                     -> cdr -> else -> etc

; Write down the cases
; For two lists to be the same:
; Each atom must be eq to the same elem for both
; Null list counts
; So:
; Terminate: return bool, check on null for both
; Recurse: using car and cdr for each list. Because we are checking that all elems are the same, we must recurse with one of the conditional operators, i.e. and.
; Cases:
; Both are null -> t
; One is null -> f
; Neither are null -> check if...
; If both are atoms -> check if...
; eq -> recur with and, using cdr
; not eq -> f
; If one is atom -> f
; If neither are atoms -> recur with and, using car and cdr
