; On page 153, the book says that length is inadequate for counting the arguments for align. This is because we are interested in whether the arguments for align become smaller as we recur on its argument (i.e. closer to termination at the first cond line). Length is inadequate as it just counts the entire argument which produces a constant value as we recur on pora (it just shifts the values). What we want is something that allows us to compare the first against the second part of the argument, as thats what we look for in the termination condition. If we use a function that counts a pora, but gives extra weight to the number of atoms in the first element, we will be able to see that the value decreases as the number of atoms in the first element gets shifted over to the second element. We are trying to prove whether or not we will reach the termination condition, i.e. if align is partial or total (its total).

; An attempt to define will-stop.
; A given function must meet the following conditions to stop:
; A terminating condition which checks at least one of the arguments
; This argument must change, and tend towards the termination condition
; If the argument does not change for many cycles, but another argument does, which will eventually cause the original argument to change, then it must be considered to be part of the original argument (as in, an expression of which)
; e.g. we can see that the second condition progresses the function towards the termination condition
;(define func
;  (lambda (A B)
;    (cond ((= A 1) 'terminated)
;          ((< B 5) (func A (+ B 1)))
